## Description

Horiseon is a digital marketing consulting company that helps their clients grow their customer bases more efficiently in the digital realm. This is their website where they advertise their services.

Horiseon's homepage looked clean and professional when I was given the source code, but there were some redundancies in the HTML and CSS that could be consolidated. In addition, some of its elements were lacking alt attributes to aid accessibility. I took it upon myself to refactor these redundancies and make the page more fully readable by a screen reader.
